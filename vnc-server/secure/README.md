Secure Setup
============

VNC server that is accessed through SSH tunnel that encrypts all traffic
between the client and the server. This is an improved implementation of 
[stable Docker container running VNC server](https://github.com/misho-kr/docker-appliances/tree/master/vnc-server/stable)
with enhanced security features.

## Encrypted traffic

The integrity and confidentiality of the traffic between the VNC viewer
and the server is protected with encryption and public key authetication.
The communication channel is established in two steps:

1. SSH tunnel is created between the host where the viewer is started
and the Docker container running the secure VNC server
1. The VNC viewer connects to the VNC server through the SSH tunnel

## SSH server

This Docker container runs SSH server that is used to create
secure channel between the client and server, and to allow passwordless
login with RSA key. Of course, it can be used to simply login to running
Docker container with _ssh_.

## Public key authentication

The secure vnc server can be accessed only if the caller has its public
RSA key uploaded to the Docker server. Here are two different ways to
get this done.

* If you are building Docker image using the _Dockefile_ in this folder,
first copy your public RSA key to a file named __vnc-server-key.pub__,
then run the _docker build_ command. The publuc key will be "baked" into
the image.

* If you have downloaded the [trusted Docker image](https://index.docker.io/u/misho1kr/vnc-secure)
first you have to acquire the private RSA key that was preloaded into the image. Download the file
[__vnc-server-key__](https://raw2.github.com/misho-kr/docker-appliances/master/vnc-server/secure/vnc-server-key)
from this GitHub repository and use it replace the public RSA key in the Docker container with your own key.

## Connecting to the secure VNC server

Create SSH tunnel then point the vnc viewer to it. If the Docker container is
running on host docker-host, and the firewall is configured to allow incoming
connections on port 5900/tcp, then the following commands will do that:


    $ ssh -L 5900:localhost:5900 docker-host
    Last login: ... from ...
    
    # open new terminal and run
    $ vinagre localhost:0


If you are using [Vinagre](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Vinagre) as vnc viewer,
it supports SSH tunneling so you don't have to create the tunnel in separate
step. Make sure to check the box _Use host ... as a SSH tunnel_.
